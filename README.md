<h1>Fake News Detection Using Logistic Regression</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
Project Overview:
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model capable of detecting unreliable or fake news articles. With the increasing spread of misinformation through digital platforms, building an automated system to distinguish between real and fake news is critical for improving information integrity and media literacy.

Problem Statement:
The objective is to classify news articles as either Real or Fake based on their textual content. Given the rise in misleading information online, an effective detection system can aid in flagging unreliable sources and maintaining trust in news consumption.

Model Approach:
Collected a labeled dataset consisting of thousands of news articles categorized as Fake or Real.
Performed data preprocessing including:
Text cleaning (removing punctuation, stopwords, and irrelevant characters)
Tokenization and normalization
Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization to convert textual data into numerical representations
Implemented a Logistic Regression model, suitable for binary classification tasks.
Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
